# error-catalog-nodejs-public

A public-facing copy of [error-catalog-nodejs](../error-catalog-nodejs) which copies most of the existing functionality
while only disclosing non-internal errors to the published NPM package.

Most of the logic in `project.json` is either directly or indirectly based off of the non-public `error-catalog-nodejs`,
and thus changes done there will reflect changes in this repository. They should be viewed as the same entity.
